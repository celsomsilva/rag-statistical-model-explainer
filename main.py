"""
FastAPI API that exposes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) endpoint.

The application loads a question–answering (QA) chain at startup and provides
a POST /ask endpoint that accepts natural language questions and returns
generated answers along with their source documents.

This API is intended to demonstrate how a statistical or analytical knowledge
base can be queried using a language model with document retrieval.
